This library is a portable C++ library that is used to generate 
coherent noise, a type of smoothly-changing noise. libnoise can 
generate Perlin noise, ridged multifractal noise, and other types 
of coherent-noise.

Coherent noise is often used by graphics programmers to generate
natural-looking textures, planetary terrain, and other things. 
The mountain scene shown above was rendered in Terragen with a 
terrain file generated by libnoise. You can also view some other
examples of what libnoise can do.

In libnoise, coherent-noise generators are encapsulated in classes 
called noise modules. There are many different types of noise modules.
Some noise modules can combine or modify the outputs of other noise
modules in various ways; you can join these modules together to
generate very complex coherent noise.

Before using libnoise, you may want to learn more about coherent noise. 
You may also want to learn how coherent noise is generated.

Note: libnoise does not generate images, it only generates coherent-noise 
values. It is up to the programmer to use these values to generate images.
